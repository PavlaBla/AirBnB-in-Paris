The French government implemented a new regulation on Airbnb hosts in 2015, which had significant implications for accommodation in Paris. 
From the data provided, we can observe that between 2008 and 2015, there was a massive increase in the number of accommodations offered via Airbnb. 
However, after the implementation of the new law, there was a significant decline, as the business became less profitable for hosts. On the other hand, 
this also led to an increase in prices, as the supply of accommodations became more limited.
